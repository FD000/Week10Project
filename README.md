# Order form with React

This week's project is to use React to build a order form. This project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## The problem

I started off by deciding what questions I should ask and what type of questions. Then I started to decide on their logic and in what order I should ask them. 

I faced troubles with creating a logic where there is only one questions asked at time and when answered and clicking to next question, the next question pops up and the previous disappears. 

Technlogies used:
- React
- CSS
